# Vocabulary practice website. 

Concept: Upload csv's with vocabularies and their translations, giving each vocabulary set a name. Then, pick which sets of vocabulary you would like to practice.

Desired program properties:
- Remembers when the last time each word has been successfully translated and is more likely to give a word/phrase that has not been seen in a while.
- New words/phrases should be successfully translated 5-6 times before the above property takes effect.
- Self marking will likely be best, given that multiple translations often exist. Although if the user types the translation identically then it should auto mark as correct.
  Perhaps it should auto mark but with the option to mark it as correct if it marks it as incorrect.
